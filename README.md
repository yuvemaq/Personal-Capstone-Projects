## Background

Hi there! 

My name is Yvonne Quiachon and welcome to my Personal Capstone Projects Portfolio! Here's a brief story about myself. I did my undergraduate at Cleveland State University where I majored in Biomedical technology. I built my foundation in biology and chemistry during my undergraduate studies. Meanwhile I was an office assistant on campus and then a pharmacy technician where I spent my time attending to peoples' medicinal needs. I wanted to become a pharmacist, as that was the next logical step to take, and so I studied physics and calculus at Cuyahoga Community College. There I discovered my knack and love for mathematics.

Now I focus on conducting analysis on subjects that engage me and honing my programming skills. I love applying my background in biomedical technology and pharmaceuticals to projects whenever I can!
